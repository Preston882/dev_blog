Throughout the past week in developing the Season Tickets App for Dobyns-Bennett Athletics, I personally have came across multiple errors including: specific seat ID clarification, creating rows, and multiple component errors. However, within this process I'm not only learning what I did wrong, but also learning more as I go. Within these errors I have achieved a better understanding in react, how to assign Local_Storage to a specific ID key, and how to successfully map arrays. As my experience throughout working with the season tickets overall, I have found ways to work against my frustration. This project has not only changed my mental state towards Programming but also helped me control my emotions.
