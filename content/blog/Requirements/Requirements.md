A user story map is a way for developers to visually see what they need to achieve by a certain end date. As shown below I have decided to take up a project that allows Athletic Directors to sell football season tickets through an online web browser.


My personal experience with said story map was exciting. I loved collaborating with others as a group to establish an end goal and how to get to that result. 

My personal contribution included: actively participating in brainstorming scenarios resulting in numerous ideas, establishing a plan to achieve the specific deliverables, and finding unique ways to make the program user friendly.
