My personal experience with the user story map was exciting. I loved collaborating with others as a group to establish an end goal and how to get to that result. 

My personal contribution included: actively participating in brainstorming scenarios resulting in numerous ideas, establishing a plan to achieve the specific deliverables, and finding unique ways to make the program user friendly.
