description: "Introduction to creating a wireframe and Kanban board"
---
In continuation of the process in developing the Season Tickets app, Today we learned how to insert and work on specific deliverables. 

While using the Kanban board me and my team at this time talked about our personal contrbution to the project would be. In my personal opinion my favorite thing about the Kanban board is the access to a Bash GUI. Not only can you see the changes you have staged but you can also commit changes without typing in any commands. 

My team also used wireframes to get an idea of what our development process would look like. A wireframe is in otherwords a blueprint for a plan. It is multiple boxes thrown together as a beginning idea.

Kanban boards and wireframes are both, very useful tools. They both give the developer a visual status as of what needs to be done by what point.
